                  <p>
                    My name is Hamza Al-Khaldi and I'm originally Palestinian but I was born and raised in Ottawa, Ottawa. I enjoy going out with friends and meeting new people. I am also very family oriented and love to spend family time with loved ones.

                    Ever since I was a kid I always wanted to travel the world and experience new things and meet new people. Sooner or later I am going to fuel my dreams to travel the world with little to no help. Why do I want no help with my journey? I have no idea. I want to start fresh and meet new people and build my journey from the bottom to the top. I want to try new foods, learn different cultures and build a family.
                     </p>
